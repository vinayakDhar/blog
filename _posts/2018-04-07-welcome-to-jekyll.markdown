Always wanted to get started with a blog of my interests, however having never maintained a personal blog as such I was faced with a semi daunting task of finding a blogging platform where creating a simple blog doesn't take a significant amount of time. Well looks like github pages and jekyll comes to the rescue, I get a personal domain and a static site generator with decent level of customization control.

So in great tradition, here is my clich√©.

{% highlight java %}
System.out.println("Hello World!");
{% endhighlight %}

Some great links which helped me to get started.
